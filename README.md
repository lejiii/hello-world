# hello-world
first Repository
i have tried to learn programming for far too long and have trusted people to help who do not want to do so

this is a failing pattern and it ends now

no longer do i take the word of liars 

i will do my own research, answer my own questions and learn what i must in order to accomplish my goals!


this will be difficult

this will be rewarding

this will be good for me in every way!
